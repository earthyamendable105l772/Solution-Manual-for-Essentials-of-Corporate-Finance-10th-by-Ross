  * Ross, Essentials of Corporate Finance, 10e, focuses on what undergraduate students with widely varying backgrounds and interests need to carry away from a core course in business or corporate finance. The goal is to convey the most important concepts and principles at a level that is approachable for the widest possible audience. To achieve this goal, subjects are distilled down to its bare essentials (hence, the name of this book), while retaining a decidedly modern approach to finance. Also, understanding the "why" is just as important, if not more so, than understanding the "how" - especially in an introductory course.
 
  * Readability and pedagogy are key. Essentials is written in a relaxed, conversational style that invites the students to join in the learning process rather than being a passive information absorber. Essentials downplays purely theoretical issues and minimizes the use of extensive and elaborate calculations to illustrate points that are either intuitively obvious or of limited practical use.
 
  * There are three basic themes visible throughout Essentials: emphasis on intuition/commonsense, a unified valuation approach, and a managerial focus.
